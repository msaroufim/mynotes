## Thoughts from tinygrad

* Windows installation was seamless but doesnt always run on Windows
* MFU built in as a environment
* Interesting not every utility is under the tinygrad namespace, for example 
* They have `from extra.datasets import fetch_mnist`
* They use the safetensor format and their functions are litterally caled save_load and safe_save
* They have both a PTX and CUDA codegen
